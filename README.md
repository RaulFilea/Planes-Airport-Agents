# Planes and Airport Agents | Intelligent Systems

A simple JAVA application that implements an agent based environment. I used JADE for creating the agents and different behaviours.

The ideea is an environment with a few planes (real and invented registration numbers) and a few airports from Romania (real ICAO code).
